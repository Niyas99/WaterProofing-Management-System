ABSTRACT

The Waterproofing Management System has been conceptualized and developed as a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution, specifically tailored for companies operating in the waterproofing industry. Recognizing the increasing importance of construction and infrastructure protection, the demand for efficient waterproofing services has grown substantially. Manual methods of managing operations in this sector often result in inefficiencies, delays, mismanaged inventories, and unsatisfactory customer service. This ERP system addresses these challenges by offering an integrated platform that centralizes customer relationship management, job allocation, inventory control, and communication between various stakeholders.

The system incorporates four principal user roles: Administrator, Administrative Staff, Dealers, and Workers, each provided with a customized dashboard and role-specific functionalities. The Administrator is responsible for overseeing the complete system, including user verification, product inventory management, complaint and feedback resolution, and the assignment of workers to job requests. Administrative Staff support these operations by managing inventory updates, handling worker assignments, and monitoring the statuses of purchase and job orders. Dealers interact with the system by registering, viewing and ordering products, requesting waterproofing services, and utilizing the complaint and feedback modules. Workers, on the other hand, receive task assignments, update job statuses in real-time, and track their daily operational activities through the system.

By deploying this ERP solution, waterproofing companies can substantially improve their operational efficiency, reduce manual errors, optimize resource allocation, and deliver superior customer service Overall, the Waterproofing Management System as an ERP framework offers a modernized, scalable, and efficient digital infrastructure to meet the evolving operational needs of the waterproofing industry.
